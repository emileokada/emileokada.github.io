In particular, I study character singularities of p-adic groups and their connections to the geometry of automorphic forms, Galois representations, and the Aubert-Zelevinsky duality. I am also interested in the role of maximal compact subgroups in representation theory and their implications for Arthur packets.</p><a href='index.html'>Back to Home</a></body></html>
